These are my personal edited files for eemie recolour / eemie + toned down mods
They contain some fixes and edits to those mods so that most furniture and such is recolored as you can see in the screenshots on my mod page
Also be aware that I made these a long time ago and so may not be up to date with current version of those mods or stardew valley updates.

The files are installed in content/maps

If anyone is willing to create content patcher versions of these then please contact me
