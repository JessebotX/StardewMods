# Summit Farm
[(nexus)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3053)

Replaces your hilltop farm with my summit farm.

## Features
- New Hilltop Farm Replacement (90x80 tiles large (Default: 80x65))
- Mini quarry is still here (cant figure out how to expand it)
- Summit Mountains changes depending on season
- Seasonal Pethouse
- Swimming Lake (requires a steel pickaxe to unlock)
- Works with new or old saves
  - For old saves, some objects(debris, crops etc. ) may be inaccessible when changing map, use a noclip mod like Passable Objects﻿ to get rid of them
  - ﻿﻿For old saves, use Entoarox Framework﻿ and type in world_bushreset and it will place the bushes on the correct spot.
- A place to relax (above your farmhouse) and has a machine that tells you your farmer stats

## Compatibility
- Works with SMAPI 2.7+ and Content Patcher 1.4+
- Known mod conflicts:
﻿﻿  - Any mod that replaces the Hilltop Farm map.
- As far as I know, it works with both singleplayer and multiplayer
